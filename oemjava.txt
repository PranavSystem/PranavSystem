Existing System:
 
 The company recruits graduates by maintaining manual recordswhich involves many loop holes.
Drawbacks:
1. Redundancy:
Manual records tend to contain data which are redundant. This isbecause Normalization followed is consistent data base is missingfeature in manual records.
2. Inconsistency:
Because of redundant data, there is no consistency in the data.
3. Time Consuming:
Maintaining each students and employees data with muchnumber of fields is a tedious process and takes more time to retrieveback.
4. Improper Validation:
There are many cases where validation is to be performedbetween the existing data and yet to be entered data. Also, a graduatewho appears for the interview and fails to succeed should 
not bereconsidered until a period of 3 months.
5. Tedious:
An organization data base goes through many numbers of updates each day which is hard to maintain in registers.
6. More HR:
In order to maintain the information of all the employees andstudents who applied for different jobs a special group of employeesshould be hired, which ultimately tends to the waste of 
resources
