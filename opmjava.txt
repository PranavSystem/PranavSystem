Functional Requirements of Final Year Project Management System
Profiles
Profile module enables supervisors to create profiles that will aid students in supervisor selection. Students can see the profile of supervisors and can send requests to them.
 Supervisors can respond to studentsâ€™ requests according to their available slots.

Feedback
Feedback modules enable supervisors to give feedback to students on their evaluated project module. This feature not only saves the time of students and supervisors but also helps 
students to align their performance if they are lacking.

Notifications
This module has real-time push notification features. Supervisors can use these features for sending meeting schedules to students in real-time. Students can receive the meeting 
schedule at the same time it was generated. These features can help students to attend meetings right on time also students can get updates directly from supervisors.

Chat
This feature enables the communication between students. Students can communicate with their group members. They can do a discussion about projects by using this module.

Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents are essential for defining the scope and functionality of software projects. Here is an example of an SRS document for an online
 project management system:

Introduction
The online project management system is a web-based application designed to help project managers and teams manage projects more efficiently. The system will provide features for 
creating and managing projects, assigning tasks to team members, tracking progress, and generating reports.

User Requirements
The system will have the following user types:

Project Manager: A user who creates and manages projects, assigns tasks, and tracks progress.
Team Member: A user who is assigned tasks and updates progress.
2.1 Functional Requirements
The system will have the following features:

Project creation: A project manager can create a new project and set its name, description, start date, and end date.
Task assignment: A project manager can assign tasks to team members and set their deadlines.
Task tracking: Team members can update the progress of their assigned tasks, and project managers can view the progress of all tasks.
Communication: The system will provide a messaging system for project managers and team members to communicate about the project.
Reporting: The system will generate reports that show project progress, task completion, and other relevant metrics.

2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: The system should be able to handle a large number of users and projects without significant delays.
Security: The system should have secure login and authentication features to protect user data.
Availability: The system should be available 24/7, with minimum downtime for maintenance.
System Requirements
The system will be developed using the following technologies:
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS
Back-end: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Hosting: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Constraints
The system should be compatible with modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
The system should follow accessibility guidelines to ensure that it is usable by people with disabilities.
Assumptions
Users will have a reliable internet connection to access the system.
Users will have basic computer skills to use the system.
The system will be used by small to medium-sized project teams.
Dependencies
The system will depend on third-party libraries and frameworks, such as ReactJS and Express.js.
The system will use Amazon Web Services for hosting, which will depend on the availability and reliability of AWS.
Acceptance Criteria
The system will be considered acceptable if it meets the following criteria:
The system should be easy to use and intuitive for both project managers and team members.
The system should be reliable and stable, with minimal downtime for maintenance.
The system should provide accurate and up-to-date information about project progress and task completion.
The system should be secure and protect user data from unauthorized access.
Glossary
Project Manager: A user who creates and manages projects, assigns tasks, and tracks progress.
Team Member: A user who is assigned tasks and updates progress.
Task: A specific activity that needs to be completed as part of a project.
Progress: The percentage of completion for a task or project.


Here are some example relation tables for an online project management system:

Users Table
This table stores information about the users who use the system, such as their name, email, password, and user ID.
Field Name	Data Type	Constraints
user_id	integer	primary key
name	varchar	not null
email	varchar	not null
password	varchar	not null
Projects Table
This table stores information about the projects in the system, such as project name, project description, and project status.
Field Name	Data Type	Constraints
project_id	integer	primary key
name	varchar	not null
description	text	
status	varchar	not null
Tasks Table
This table stores information about the tasks for each project, such as task name, task description, task status, and the user assigned to the task.
Field Name	Data Type	Constraints
task_id	integer	primary key
project_id	integer	foreign key
name	varchar	not null
description	text	
status	varchar	not null
assigned_to	integer	foreign key
Comments Table
This table stores information about the comments on tasks, such as comment ID, task ID, user ID, and the comment text.
Field Name	Data Type	Constraints
comment_id	integer	primary key
task_id	integer	foreign key
user_id	integer	foreign key
comment	text	not null

User_Projects Table
This table stores the association between users and projects they are involved in, such as user ID and project ID.
Field Name	Data Type	Constraints
user_id	integer	foreign key
project_id	integer	foreign key
These are just examples of tables that might be used in an online project management system, and there may be additional tables or fields depending on the 
specific requirements of the system.

In the context of an online project management system, the business entity could be a company or organization that provides the online platform for managing and collaborating
 on projects. Here are some possible business entities involved in an online project management system:

Project Management Software Company: This is the main business entity that owns and operates the online project management platform. They may offer a suite of tools for managing
 projects, such as task management, team collaboration, and reporting.

Project Managers: These are the individuals responsible for planning, executing, and closing projects using the online project management system. They may use the platform to create 
and assign tasks, track progress, and communicate with team members.

Team Members: These are the individuals who are assigned tasks and work on projects using the online project management system. They may use the platform to view their tasks, provide 
updates, and communicate with other team members.

Clients: These are the individuals or organizations for whom the projects are being completed. They may have access to the online project management system to view project progress, 
provide feedback, and communicate with the project team.

Integrations: These are other software tools that may integrate with the online project management system to provide additional functionality. For example, a time tracking tool may 
integrate with the project management system to automatically track the time spent on each task.

Administrators: These are the individuals who manage the user accounts and settings for the online project management system. They may configure access permissions, manage integrations,
 and generate reports.

These are just some examples of the business entities that could be involved in an online project management system, and there may be additional entities depending on the specific system
 and industry.
